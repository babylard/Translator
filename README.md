# Translator

Translator is a simple application built using Python and PySimpleGUI that allows users to translate 
text from one language (which is auto-detected) to another. The application leverages the translate library. There is
a button present that allows you to copy output translations to the clipboard quickly.

I plan to make an offline version of this application soon so you dont always have to rely on an internet connection for translation.
